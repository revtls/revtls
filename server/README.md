Before executing the server, you need to configure the GOROOT environment variable using our [GOROOT](https://github.com/revtls/revtls/tree/main/go).

```
$ vi ~/.bashrc
//Add the following commands to your bashrc
export GOPATH=<your GOPATH path>
export GOROOT=<your GOROOT path>
export PATH=$PATH:<your GOROOT path>/bin
// Save and close the bashrc

// Apply the newly added environment variables
$ source ~/.bashrc
```
You also need to locate your TLS certificate and its private key here
```
$ cp <your TLS certificate location> ./
$ cp <your TLS certificate's private key location> ./

//NOTE: If the names of your TLS certificate and its corresponding private key differ from cert.pem and privatekey.pem, please rename them accordingly.
```

You are now able to run the RDC-supporting HTTPS server using tlsServer.go. tlsServer.go creates an RDC and its private key using privkey.pem (TLS certificate's private key), and it uses cert.pem (TLS certificate), domainOwnerDDC.json (RDC), and domainOwnerDDCKey.pem (RDCâ€™s private key) to launch the RDC-supporting HTTPS server (see 66 line in the tlsServer.go).

```
$ go run tlsServer.go

//If you encounter an error saying "package certandrdcgen is not in GOROOT', try 'go env -w GO111MODULE=off'
```
