## Running the RDC-supporting HTTPS server

### Set up GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables
```
# Root permission is required to run the HTTPS server on port 443.
Your_server:~$ sudo -i

# Set up GOROOT and GOPATH environment variables
Your_server(root):~$ vi ~/.bashrc
# Add the following commands to your bashrc
export GOPATH=<Path where the revtls is cloned>/revtls
export GOROOT=<Path where the revtls is cloned>/revtls/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
# Save and close the bashrc

# Apply the newly added environment variables
Your_server(root):~$ source ~/.bashrc

# Disabling GO111MODULE to enable the GOPATH environment
Your_server(root):~$ go env -w GO111MODULE=off
```

### Copy your TLS certificate and its private key to the GOPATH

```
$ cp <your TLS certificate location> $GOPATH/cert.pem
$ cp <your TLS certificate's private key location> $GOPATH/privkey.pem
```

### Execute the tlsServer.go to run the RDC-supporting HTTPS server
You are now able to run the RDC-supporting HTTPS server using tlsServer.go. tlsServer.go creates an RDC and its private key using privkey.pem (TLS certificate's private key), and it uses cert.pem (TLS certificate), domainOwnerDDC.json (RDC), and domainOwnerDDCKey.pem (RDCâ€™s private key) to launch the RDC-supporting HTTPS server (see 66 line in the tlsServer.go).

```
$ go run tlsServer.go
```
